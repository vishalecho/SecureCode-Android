> ***Security Fundamental and Application Security Weaknesses (Mobile)***

### Security Fundamentals

> ***Application Security Concepts***

* Least Privileges
* Secure By Default
* Defence in Depth
* Robust Error Checking
* Trust No Input
* Open Design
* Fail Securely
* Reuse Of Existing Security Controls In A Framework Or Language
* Logging
* Data Protection

> ***Secure Development Lifecycle***

> ***Secure Architecture***

### Application Security Weaknesses
> ***Mobile***

- Sensitive Data Protection

	* Insecure Data Storage

		- Plaintext Storage Of Credentials
		- Storage On SDCard / External Storage
		- Storage Of Binary Cookies
		- Storage In Plist Or XML Files
		- Storage In Log Files
		- Storage In SQLite Database

- Insecure Development Practices

	* Insufficient Transport Layer Protection 
		- Weak Cipher Suites
		- Trusting Self-Signed Or Untrusted Certificates
		- Weak Certificate Validation
		- Communication Over Cleartext Protocol
		- Improper Certificate Pinning Configuration

	* Broken Cryptography 
		- Use Of Hardcoded Keys
		- use Of Encoding
		- Use Of Insecure/Deprecated Algorithms
		- use Of Short Encryption Keys

- Authentication and Access Control

	* Insecure Authentication
		- Storing Credentials With 'Remember Me' Functionality
		- Use Of Spoofable Parameters For Authentication
		- Uses Of Weak Passwords
		- Client Side Authentication For Authenticating To Server
		- Hardcoded API Keys
		- Weak Lockout Mechanism
		- Misuse Of Fingerprint
		- Password Enumeration
		- Username Enumeration

	* Insecure Authorization
		- Broken Access Control
		- Insecure Direct Object Reference
